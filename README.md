# IS543 - HW4
## Instructions
Build a SwiftUI interface for a 4-function calculator app. You could try nesting HStacks and VStacks to build the interface, or you could try learning about LazyVGrid. You don't need to program the full functionality of the calculator. But create a beautiful user interface. Use color, fonts, and spacing thoughtfully. Pay attention to the details.
